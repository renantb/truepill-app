## üèó Installation

To open you just need to right-click on the index.html file and select the open with and select the browser option (I recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/new/))

## üìÑ Description

üíª This application was developed and tested in Mac OS, Linux Mint and Linux Ubuntu environments, therefore, it does not guarantee full operation in a Windows environment. Accessing it is simple: just right-click on the index.html file and select the open in browser option (I recommend using Chrome or Mozilla).
It is also possible to access it through a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) plugin called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), just open the index.html file and right-click on the file and select the option: Open with Live Server.

üíª This application was developed using HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript and JQuery. It's purpose is to serve as a medication registry and inventory control. 
The user provides the amount of the medication and through a [table](https://github.com/renantb/truepill-app/blob/main/Medications.jpg) at figure below and he adds the strength and size of the package of each medication.
There are three buttons: Register (records the medication), Clear (clears the fields) and Stock Levels (checks the stock levels, shown in a table below the application).

## A few observations:	
- I‚Äôve tried to match the buttons and colors with those of the Truepill UK sites.
- You can delete the table by clicking on the left mouse button, select the inspect option, then on application, Storage, Local Storage and left-click on Value and select delete.
